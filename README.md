Project 06 - Swords and Shields!

Resources:
- I used the starting point and class lecture video to start the assignment.
- I also heavily relied on my Keypad code and SpaceShooter code and knowledge to complete extra components, such as the buttons and instantiating the swords and shields.
- https://answers.unity.com/questions/410875/how-can-i-hide-a-gameobject-without-activefalse.html - I used this website and the code with modification to hide and show the buttons.
